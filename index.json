  "content": "\n<h3> A.R.E.S. </h3>\nTries to be a Metroidvania, but sucks at it. Wander about, kill stuff, collect cogs, use them to upgrade your thingamawhatzit. \n\n<h3> BEEP </h3> \nPhysics in a platformer is a good idea, but that doesn't make this a good game. \n\n<h3> The Binding of Isaac </h3>\nCame for the off-colour subject matter. Tears aren't a satisfying weapon. It's not totally clear what half of the power-ups do.  Left because no matter of procedural content generation can save a game that's full of shit. \n\n<h3> Magicka </h3>\nWorth it, but only if you pay less than five bucks. The magic system is cleverly designed and fun to dick around with until you've tried all of the combinations in a variety of different situations. The humor is forced and awful. \n\n<h3> LIMBO </h3>\nIt starts out awesomely thematic, but then totally fails to deliver on the cool premise. Then it becomes a run-of-the-mill puzzle platformer. At least it was short. \n\n<h3> Universe Sandbox </h3> \nYou will spend half an hour learning approximately how it works and blowing up a few universes. That is all. It's too complicated to build anything of note in, unless you're willing to devote hundreds of hours to LEARNING. \n\n<h3> Sequence </h3>\nThe core gameplay is solid.  You got RPG in my rhythm game! The engine is buggy, the music is forgettable, and the grind sucks the fun out of a strong mechanic. Well, then. \n\n<h3> Bastion </h3> \nThe actual game of Bastion is a run-of-the-mill 3rd-person action RPG.  There is nothing run-of-the-mill about the delivery, though. Bastion looks beautiful, sounds beautiful, and tells a story - and they didn't skimp on the polish when it comes to the gameplay, either. A+. \n\n<h3> Galactic Civilizations II </h3>\n\nThis felt a lot like a Civilization game, even if it is by another company entirely. They do a lot of things better than Civ does them - wide tech tree, unique-feeling civilizations, powerful branching strategies, improved diplomacy, and smart AI opponents.  They do some things worse, too - Civ builds a much more cohesive world map, well-thought-out combat, and civil management structure.\n\n<h3> Deus Ex: Human Revolution </h3>\n\nThis is an excellent game, and a worthy successor to the Deus Ex name. It makes a few irritating mistakes (don't forget: the original had its share of niggling problems) - the main character is a forgettable knob, the ending is unsatisfying, there's DLC, the boss fights are a pain in the ass, and the upgrade system really allows you to have your cake and eat it, too. (You want everything? You'll get everything!) - All those things considered, it's still great at being a Deus Ex game. \n\n<h3> Worms Reloaded </h3>\n\nIt's every other Worms game ever.  There's no way to improve on the formula. It's great at parties. Boom.\n\n<h3> Serious Sam 3 </h3>\n\nSerious Sam is the glorious B-Movie of video games. It's not serious, it doesn't take itself seriously, and anywhere where it might have taken itself seriously it puts an explosion instead. Like a B-Movie, enjoying it with friends is non-optional.  Infinite respawn on.  Respawn in place off. \n\nThere are lots of things that <em>should</em> make it a bad game. There are key-card fetch quests. The first three or four levels are boring and closed and maze-like. Occasionally a real stinker of a level comes along and you're doing underground platforming puzzles or something.  There's an almost imperceptible transition, however, to a point in the game where you are shooting rockets at everything that moves and running around at blazing speeds like a madman with a sledgehammer with a group of your friends.  Amazin'. \n\n<h3> Batman: Arkham Asylum </h3>\n\nIt takes a lot of buttons to be Bats - I'm used to the indie game three-buttons-and-you're-good world. I'm losing touch with the sort of game where you have to press left-down-right-trigger-right-bumper-a-b-up in order to whip a Batarang into someone's crotch then grappling hook to safety. The world is tiny and claustrophobic, the story is awful, and Batman's 'detective sense' is irritating and smug.  Even so, the many glowing reviews aren't _wrong_. The game absolutely nails anything that it tries to do. Stealth, combat, exploration... It's a good game. I might need to play some more to really get into it. \n\nAlso, Games For Windows Live. Ugh. \n",

They use unit testing.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> I beefed that unit testing, bro\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> hella beefed\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> haha\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 1. To catch 'regressions' - modules that used to work, but now don't, thanks to a change that you have inadvertently made.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 2. To stop your idiot co-workers from changing the behavior of your modules without asking you, first.\n<strong>n0ob \t:</strong> 2.a. Unless they are smart enough to run the tests and modify them\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> 1.b. to avoid really lame-ass errors being found in user testing and wasting someone's bench time (at my work)\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 3. To partially document the proper use of your module. (\"How is this supposed to work?\" \"Ooooooh.\" )\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 4. In the case of _interpreted_ languages, to catch errors that normally would be caught in a compilation step in _compiled_ languages.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> \"Oh, shit, this function doesn't even exist. \"\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> 5. to look like you're coding something day, but dont need to have anything to show for it\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> ^\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> haha yes\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 6. The act of designing your code in order to be easily black-box testable by an outside entity also forces you to modularize the design in ways that are almost always positive.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> wildcard0: except last week. I have pages upon pages of labels to show for our regression test\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> my coworker was all \"this was a fun kindergarten excercise of cut and paste. I'm going to hang this in my cubicle\"\n<strong>triskele \t:</strong> today's word: beef (v) beefed, beefing\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> \"arts and crafts dept\"\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> haha\n<strong>triskele \t:</strong> beef as a verb.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> Beefocity.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> wildcard0: exackly\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> To write a unit test is simple.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> It's basically just a little block of code.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> You select a single THING that you want to test.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> And write code to test that THING.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> \\o/\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> There are some guidelines that make this simpler:\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 1. If you find yourself creating and instantiating modules that _aren't_ the module you're testing, you are accidentally writing an integration test.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 2. If you accidentally write 'creating and instantiating' as if they were two different things, you will feel FOOLISH.\n<em>plypkie \tsmirks</em>\n<strong>n0ob \t:</strong> [[myclass alloc] init]\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> 3. You can demonstrate the difference between creating and instantiating in java very easily, though not so much in a lot of other languages\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 1a. A good way to get around this is to create 'dummy' objects that have properties similar to the ones you would be passing to your Module, but with vastly more simple behavior.

They use unit testing.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> I beefed that unit testing, bro\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> hella beefed\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> haha\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 1. To catch 'regressions' - modules that used to work, but now don't, thanks to a change that you have inadvertently made.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 2. To stop your idiot co-workers from changing the behavior of your modules without asking you, first.\n<strong>n0ob \t:</strong> 2.a. Unless they are smart enough to run the tests and modify them\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> 1.b. to avoid really lame-ass errors being found in user testing and wasting someone's bench time (at my work)\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 3. To partially document the proper use of your module. (\"How is this supposed to work?\" \"Ooooooh.\" )\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 4. In the case of _interpreted_ languages, to catch errors that normally would be caught in a compilation step in _compiled_ languages.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> \"Oh, shit, this function doesn't even exist. \"\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> 5. to look like you're coding something day, but dont need to have anything to show for it\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> ^\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> haha yes\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 6. The act of designing your code in order to be easily black-box testable by an outside entity also forces you to modularize the design in ways that are almost always positive.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> wildcard0: except last week. I have pages upon pages of labels to show for our regression test\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> my coworker was all \"this was a fun kindergarten excercise of cut and paste. I'm going to hang this in my cubicle\"\n<strong>triskele \t:</strong> today's word: beef (v) beefed, beefing\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> \"arts and crafts dept\"\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> haha\n<strong>triskele \t:</strong> beef as a verb.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> Beefocity.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> wildcard0: exackly\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> To write a unit test is simple.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> It's basically just a little block of code.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> You select a single THING that you want to test.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> And write code to test that THING.\n<strong>eqj^w^ \t:</strong> \\o/\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> There are some guidelines that make this simpler:\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 1. If you find yourself creating and instantiating modules that _aren't_ the module you're testing, you are accidentally writing an integration test.\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 2. If you accidentally write 'creating and instantiating' as if they were two different things, you will feel FOOLISH.\n<em>plypkie \tsmirks</em>\n<strong>n0ob \t:</strong> [[myclass alloc] init]\n<strong>wildcard0 \t:</strong> 3. You can demonstrate the difference between creating and instantiating in java very easily, though not so much in a lot of other languages\n<strong>Boose|work \t:</strong> 1a. A good way to get around this is to create 'dummy' objects that have properties similar to the ones you would be passing to your Module, but with vastly more simple behavior. In static languages, this involves a lot of magic and interfaces and mocking libraries, like \"RhinoMocks\" or \"Moq\".

  "content": "Recently, Priceonomics posted [this](http://priceonomics.com/cookware/), the \"Minimum Viable Kitchen\", laying\nout the supplies that Matt Maroon found necessary to make a viable kitchen for under $1000. \n\nHis supplies, though, seem entirely too fancy.  I mean, I'm sure that some people can get by on nothing but \na microwave and some forks, but I still think that this Minimum Viable Kitchen is too.. maximum.  \n\n- The Thomas Keller cookbook, Ad Hoc at Home; is a favourite cookbook of my younger brother, who has finished a \nculinary school degree.  For persons looking to seriously upgrade their cooking skills, it's an excellent book.\nBut it's not a part of my kitchen - because the recipes have prep-times that rove from 'days' at the slowest to\n'hours' at the fastest. \n> ![Ain't nobody got time for that.](http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8um5czsa51qawgya.gif).\nThe recipes contain sub-recipes. The meats require brining. You are to prepare and use your own stock. \nAs much as I respect persons willing to spend 8 hours on a cooking project - and I do - I'm usually looking\nfor things that can be prepared in 15 minutes to an hour. Think [Stone Soup](http://thestonesoup.com/blog/#)\nor [Just Bento](http://justbento.com/).\n- The KitchenAid stand mixer. It is a godsend for people making doughs, baking, or preparing cheesecakes. For\npastry-chefs, it's a good get. I'm not a pastry chef. There are also loads and loads of kitschy single-use\nattachments for kitchen projects that you will try once and then never again, like pasta-making, sausage-extruding, \nand iced-cream churning. \n- Scale.  If you're a baker, or you're running a commercial kitchen, you must invest in a scale. I am neither of those things. \n- Ice Cream Maker? Seriously? \n\nI thought I'd put together a much simpler list for Bachelor Cookin'. \n\n- _Pots_. 2 sauce-pots, and a stock pot.  Don't go too cheap - nice, thick ones are actually a lot less likely to burn your food. \nThe sauce-pots are good for just about anything - boiling eggs, Kraft dinner, actual sauces - and the stock pot is useful for \nlots and lots of noodles, bigger projects (Chili, Bolognese)- and actual stock. \n- _Non-Stick Pan_.  You _should_ go cheap on this one, because the teflon coating will wear off after a year, no matter how expensive\nthe pan is.  Remember the Rules of Teflon:\n  - No metal in the pan. No forks, no steel wool, no scraping.\n  - Never heat a Teflon pan past 5/6 on your stove, unless you like clouds of invisible toxic gas. \n- _Knives_.  French knife, paring knife.  I like a little sharp serrated knife for tomatoes, but that's pretty optional.\n- _Cutting Boards_.  A plastic one should do.  I like to maintain separate boards for veggies and meats, to limit cross-contamination potential.\n- _Spatula_.  A silicone spatula, one single [unit](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00mvjtoSdcGkbP/Silicone-Spatula-Bakeware.jpg)\n (rather than [two bits stuck together](http://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00teqTbDKlbkYw/Silicone-Spatula.jpg)) can be cleaned in SECONDS. Which\n makes it one of my favourite kitchen tools. \n- _Dutch Oven_ and _Baking Pan_.  For putting things in the oven and leaving them there for a while. \n- _Mixing Bowls_. For mixing things. I also eat out of these when I'm lazy, because they're super easy to clean. \n- _Ramekins_.  It's nice to have small bowls around for.. dipping things in. Ramekins are great for this, plus they're oven-safe. \n- _Measuring Tools_.  You know, tsp, 1/2 tsp, tbsp, cup, those things. Also, a liquid measure - one of those Pyrex glass liquid measuring cups. \n- _Spoons_.  For serving and stirring. Ladle. Slotted spoon. Wooden spoon. \n- _Colander_.  For draining pasta.\n- _Box Grater_.  For grating things to a variety of different widths. \n- _Tongs_.  Tongs are great for everything. They're like long fingers that are impervious to heat. \n\nThat seems like just about everything.  What do _you_ think is required kitchen equipment? What would you add?

  "html": "<p>Recently, Priceonomics posted <a href=\"http://priceonomics.com/cookware/\">this</a>, the &quot;Minimum Viable Kitchen&quot;, laying\nout the supplies that Matt Maroon found necessary to make a viable kitchen for under $1000. </p>\n<p>His supplies, though, seem entirely too fancy.  I mean, I&#39;m sure that some people can get by on nothing but \na microwave and some forks, but I still think that this Minimum Viable Kitchen is too.. maximum.  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Thomas Keller cookbook, Ad Hoc at Home; is a favourite cookbook of my younger brother, who has finished a \nculinary school degree.  For persons looking to seriously upgrade their cooking skills, it&#39;s an excellent book.\nBut it&#39;s not a part of my kitchen - because the recipes have prep-times that rove from &#39;days&#39; at the slowest to\n&#39;hours&#39; at the fastest. <blockquote>\n<p><img src=\"http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_m8um5czsa51qawgya.gif\" alt=\"Ain&#39;t nobody got time for that.\">.\nThe recipes contain sub-recipes. The meats require brining. You are to prepare and use your own stock. \nAs much as I respect persons willing to spend 8 hours on a cooking project - and I do - I&#39;m usually looking\nfor things that can be prepared in 15 minutes to an hour. Think <a href=\"http://thestonesoup.com/blog/#\">Stone Soup</a>\nor <a href=\"http://justbento.com/\">Just Bento</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</li>\n<li>The KitchenAid stand mixer. It is a godsend for people making doughs, baking, or preparing cheesecakes. For\npastry-chefs, it&#39;s a good get. I&#39;m not a pastry chef. There are also loads and loads of kitschy single-use\nattachments for kitchen projects that you will try once and then never again, like pasta-making, sausage-extruding, \nand iced-cream churning. </li>\n<li>Scale.  If you&#39;re a baker, or you&#39;re running a commercial kitchen, you must invest in a scale. I am neither of those things. </li>\n<li>Ice Cream Maker? Seriously? </li>\n</ul>\n<p>I thought I&#39;d put together a much simpler list for Bachelor Cookin&#39;. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Pots</em>. 2 sauce-pots, and a stock pot.

I think that anybody who can't muster up the\nchutzpah to murder a woodland creature should seriously consider\nbecoming a vegetarian - it's a much more tenable moral position.\nHunting rifles, though, are a specific flavor of rifle, and it is\nentirely reasonable to mandate a raft of home-safety controls for\nthese rifles; separate ammunition, trigger-locks, and the like. \nI mean, if you're only going to use this weapon for hunting... \n\nThen there's the 'democracy' argument - on the off chance that the\ngovernment happens to overstep its bounds and armed revolution is\nrequired, it would be best not to be without weaponry. It's a check\nagainst the power of government! A powerful, _wildly impractical_ \nsymbol of democracy! A guerilla measure of last resort! \nI'm, not really sure what I think about\nthis argument - but regardless, the trigger-locks and separate ammunition\ncould still be in place for the purpose of last-minute democracy. \nI mean, in a time of revolution,\nbreaking the law would be your last concern, yeah? \n\nSo, then, there's the argument from 'safety'.  \"I have the right to \nprotect my family.\". This has kind of a prisoner's dilemma feel to it. \nIf you buy a gun in order to feel safe, you have added a gun to this \nclosed system, marginally decreasing total safety for everyone. \nIf one person buys a gun to feel safe, everybody needs\nto buy a gun in order to feel safe. Now everybody has a gun and the \nsystem on-the-whole has become much less safe. \n\nWell, at least, _I_ think \nthat universal armament would probably be a terrible idea.

Hunters and freedom nutjobs still have a valid claim \nto guns. In systems where people feel that they _need_ a gun to feel safe, \neither\nprohibition will be contravened (the \"gun control only gets guns out of the\nhands of law-abiding citizens\" argument) or the concept of prohibition will \nseem so antithetical that it will never be implemented.

  "content": "### Day 1\n* Curtis puts ~$60 of gas into John Matrix.\n* Jonathan and Angelina are collected at New Westminster Station.\n* Curtis buys ~$50 of supplies for Salmon Dinner. \n* [Tunes!](http://www.rdio.com/people/classam/playlists/3972768/Shuswap_Megamix/)\n* A pit stop for breakfast in Hope; Angelina is declared to be a Mountain Man. \n* Jonathan eats a literal mountain of mushrooms.\n* A plan is advanced: Why not do a [Magic draft](http://www.wikihow.com/Hold-a-Magic:-the-Gathering-Booster-Draft)? \n      But where could we buy the requisite ingredients? \n* Jonathan uses technology to find a game store in Kamloops.\n* Driving!\n* The game store is raided. It is a magical place, the walls lined with\n  board games, collectible card games, retro video game technology, and\n  bearded men.\n* Jonathan finds a book he has not seen since he was in High School.\n* Magic is Gathered. Angelina puts down ~$150 for the good of the team.\n* Arrival at cabin. Curtis' car is unloaded. It is once again laden with\n  technical gear and books and nothing even remotely appropriate for the\n  outdoors.\n* Curtis installs Internet. Must-have. \n* A detailed shopping list is heroically prepared. \n* The terrible, terrible romantic novel that Curtis read at the cabin\n  last time is unveiled. \"You've Got Male\". Curtis promises to extract\n  key awful-writing chunks to post to the internet. \n* \"You've got your recreational boating license, but how are you going \n  to use the sea-doo wearing glasses? The first time you fall off, they'll\n  sink into the sea and you'll lose them forever.\"   \"Shit.\" \n* A plan is espoused involving string or fishing wire.\n* Jonathan unearths cedar planks that he brought just for the salmon. \n  Kitchen magic occurs: salmon with a creamy dill-and-cucumber\n  sauce, rice, and a zucchini-and-corn vegetable mix. Everybody immediately\n  realizes why inviting Jonathan was a great idea.\n* Vlad very much does not do a pull-up. \n* Curtis is dish-bitch.\n* Hive is introduced. Jonathan wins.\n* Pillars of the Earth is played. Travis wins. \n* Jonathan returns to the kitchen to prepare Crepe Supplies for the \n  following morning. A caramel appears. \n* Vlad manufactures a fire.\n* Curtis drinks 3 Gin & Lemonade, 2 Pear Cider, 1 Apple Cider\n\n### Day 2\n* Coffee with a hefty dose of Bailey's to start the day.\n* Jonathan makes crepes. With lemon curd and cherries. And apple caramel filling. They are delicious.\n* Courtney washes dishes. \n* A dock is repaired.\n* An expedition: Vlad pays for $550 worth of groceries. A Super-Valu is emptied out entirely. \n* A surf shop. Curtis buys ridiculous looking equipment to safeguard his glasses. \n* Angelina Gets: +2 Shades of Sun-Looking.\n* Fridge Tetris. The fridge is now at 100% capacity. MEAT IS EVERYWHERE. \n* Curtis finishes a new Cube Drone. \n* Caramel + Apples = Delicious\n* Many books are contributed to a small mountain. \n* Travis floods the boat.\n* Curtis resolves to download \"Above & Beyond\" \n* Angelina discovers a fountain of everlasting mojitos, \n  declaring them the best thing in the world. \n* Every time Travis opens a beer, it explodes.\n* No bets are taken on the odds of the power going out. \n* Angelina declares burritos the best thing in the world. \n* Angelina declares pie the best thing in the world. \n* Angelina declares couch the best thing in the world.\n* A Revolution occurs. A Dance Dance Revolution. \n* Curtis trinks 2 Lin & Gemonade, 2 Apple Cider\n\n### Day 3\n* Eggs Benedict! Browns are hashed. \n* Dominion is played. Vlad wins, then Jonathan wins. \n* Stupid Robot rides again!\n* Leftover burrito supplies are converted into a many-layered dip, and\n  served with tortilla chips. \n* PUPPY! \n* SO CUTE OH MY GOD! \n* LOOKIDA PUPPY! WHO'S A CUTE LITTLE PUPPY! YOU ARE! \n* Incidentally, Yang & Viv arrive.   \n* Basil appears! Gimlets to appear in the future. \n* Travis and Vlad sail away, come sail away.\n* Roasted chicken with a tortellini salad for dinner. \n* Lactose pills for everyone!\n* Angelina is critically injured by a smore.\n\n### Day 4\n* Dominion! \n* Cinnamon Buns and Sausages! \n* Curtis and Jonathan clean many dishes. \n* A Magic Draft occurs. \n* Curtis deals a lot of damage, quickly. \n* The \"Exalted\" special ability and the \"Lifelink\" special ability happen to Curtis. Ouch.  \n* The puppy remains super snuggly. \n* It's sunny out! An expedition to the lake. \n* An inflatable island is constructed, stocked with alcohol, and then floated into the lake. \n* Vlad learns no lessons about cannonballing. We're drinking here, come on!\n* A dragonfly messily devours a mosquito on Angelina's finger.\n* Curtis badgers Angelina into keeping him up-to-date with Conference Stuff so that Curtis can attempt to put together talks. \n* The tortellini salad takes to the sea and is consumed by hungry inflatable-islanders. \n* More Magic playing. Yang proves his deck against Courteney. Curtis wins one against Angelina. \n* The pile of steaks is monstrous. \n* Everybody falls into a steak coma. \n\n### Day 5\n* Travis & Angelina go fishing. Everybody bribed to corroborate story\n  of 8 foot sturgeon who juuust got away. \n* Vlad makes a smallish bowl of beans for breakfast. \n* Jonathan spends the entire day managing oxtails and onions.\n* A farmer's market! Berries are purchased.\n* Time for a supplemental shopping run! More eggs! Sangria supplies! \n* A sangria is quietly prepared behind the scenes. \n* Everybody gets a fresh booster. More Magic is played. \n  Curtis' deck, while clearly superior, loses about 70% of the time.  \n* Oxtail and french onion soup!\n* Parks and Recreation! \n\n### Day 6\n* Meat and cabbage piroshki. Dozens of them. \n* A lone cherry piroshki is chased. It is cartoonish and humorous. \n* An inflatable island. Everybody gets too much sun.  \n* Dramatic readings of a Happy Days book. The Fonz is so cool.\n* \"Hoochie Coochie\" is said 40+ times, mostly by The Fonz. \n* Also, everybody who is not The Fonz is a nerd. \n* Tzolkin gets a play. Giant gears! \n* Everyone gets more Magic cards. No good packs are opened. \n* Burgers are delicious. There is bleu cheese in them.\n\n### Day 7\n* Yang & Viv leave, taking their cloud/dog with them. \n* Cheesy cornbread biscuits and sausages for breakfast.\n* Miniature Golf. Courteney wins, due to cheatery and further shenanigans. \n* Curtis heroically comes in second place with honest dealings and truths. \n* Ice, iced cream sandwiches, and frozen treats are purchased during a \n  water run.\n* Jonathan prepares Lime Beerguaritas. They are very boozy and quite tasty. \n* An inflatable island shows up again. It is very hot out, and soon\n   100% of the cabineers are islandgoers.\n* Vlad learns an important lesson about sun and Beerguaritas\n\n### Day 8\n* Lawns, mowed.\n* Today is leftovers day. \n* Curtis' observational skills are dulled by hours of Dance Dance Revolution and swimming.\n* Game of Thrones. Hours of wheeling, dealing, and backstabbing. \n\n### Day 9 \n* Everybody packs up and heads home. \n",

  "content": "So, I wrote a [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20963273/spa-best-practices-for-authentication-and-session-management/21175036#21175036)\nanswer that I'm almost proud of, and I thought I'd keep it here.\n\nThe question? I'm going to paraphrase, here:\n\n\"Is there a best-practices for authentication of single-page Javascript \napplications? Should I keep my own token, or use the session-management \nbuilt in to my framework?\" \n\nMy answer? \n\nThis question has been addressed, in a slightly different form, at length, \nin [this StackOverflow answer about RESTful authentication](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/319530/restful-authentication).\n\nBut this addresses it from the server-side. Let's look at this from the client-side. Before we do that, though, there's an important prelude:\n\n## Javascript Crypto is Hopeless ##\n\n[Matasano's article](http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/)\non this is famous, but the lessons contained therein are pretty important:\n\nTo summarize: \n\n* A man-in-the-middle attack can trivially replace your crypto code with `<script>\n  function hash_algorithm(password){ lol_nope_send_it_to_me_instead(password); }</script>`\n* A man-in-the-middle attack is trivial against a page that serves any resource over a non-SSL connection.\n* Once you have SSL, you're using real crypto anyways.\n\nAnd to add a corollary of my own:\n\n* A successful XSS attack can result in an attacker executing code on your client's browser, even if you're using SSL - so even if you've got every hatch battened down, your browser crypto can still fail if your attacker finds a way to execute any javascript code on someone else's browser. \n\nThis renders a lot of RESTful authentication schemes impossible or silly if you're intending to use a JavaScript client. Let's look! \n\n## HTTP Basic Auth ##\n\nFirst and foremost, HTTP Basic Auth. The simplest of schemes: simply pass a name and password with every request.\n\nThis, of course, absolutely requires SSL, because you're passing a Base64 (reversibly) encoded name and password with every request. Anybody listening on the line could extract username and password trivially. Most of the \"Basic Auth is insecure\" arguments come from a place of \"Basic Auth over HTTP\" which is an awful idea. \n\nThe browser provides baked-in HTTP Basic Auth support, but it is ugly as sin and you probably shouldn't use it for your app. The alternative, though, is to stash username and password in JavaScript.\n\nThis is the most RESTful solution. The server requires no knowledge of state whatsoever and authenticates every individual interaction with the user. Some REST enthusiasts (mostly strawmen) insist that maintaining any sort of state is heresy and will froth at the mouth if you think of any other authentication method. There are theoretical benefits to this sort of standards-compliance - it's supported by Apache out of the box - you could store your objects as files in folders protected by .htaccess files if your heart desired!\n\nThe _problem_? You are caching on the client-side a username and password. This gives evil.ru a better crack at it - even the most basic of XSS vulnerabilities could result in the client beaming his username and password to an evil server. You could try to alleviate this risk by hashing and salting the password, but remember: _JavaScript Crypto is Hopeless_. You could alleviate this risk by leaving it up to the Browser's Basic Auth support, but.. ugly as sin, as mentioned earlier. \n\n## HTTP Digest Auth ##\n\n[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5288150/digest-authentication-w-jquery-is-it-possible](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5288150/digest-authentication-w-jquery-is-it-possible)\n\nA more \"secure\" auth, this is a request/response hash challenge. Except _JavaScript Crypto is Hopeless_, so it only works over SSL and you still have to cache the username and password on the client side, making it more complicated than HTTP Basic Auth but _no more secure_.\n\n## Query Authentication with Additional Signature Parameters. ##\n\nAnother more \"secure\" auth, where you encrypt your parameters with nonce and timing data (to protect against repeat and timing attacks) and send the. One of the best examples of this is the OAuth 1.0 protocol, which is, as far as I know, a pretty stonking way to implement authentication on a REST server. \n\n[RFC 5849: OAuth 1.0](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5849)\n\nOh, but there aren't any OAuth 1.0 clients for JavaScript. Why?  \n\n_JavaScript Crypto is Hopeless_, remember. JavaScript can't participate in OAuth 1.0 without SSL, and you still have to store the client's username and password locally - which puts this in the same category as Digest Auth - it's more complicated than HTTP Basic Auth but it's _no more secure_. \n\n## Token ##\n\nThe user sends a username and password, and in exchange gets a token that can be used to authenticate requests. \n\nThis is marginally more secure than HTTP Basic Auth, because as soon as the username/password transaction is complete you can discard the sensitive data. It's also less RESTful, as tokens constitute \"state\" and make the server implementation more complicated. \n\n### SSL Still ###\n\nThe rub though, is that you still have to send that initial username and password to get a token. Sensitive information still touches your compromisable JavaScript. \n\nTo protect your user's credentials, you still need to keep attackers out of your JavaScript, and you still need to send a username and password over the wire. SSL Required.\n\n### Token Expiry ###\nIt's common to enforce token policies like \"hey, when this token has been around too long, discard it and make the user authenticate again.\" or \"I'm pretty sure that the only IP address allowed to use this token is `XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`\". Many of these policies are pretty good ideas.\n\n### Firesheeping ###\n\nHowever, using a token Without SSL is still vulnerable to an attack called 'sidejacking': http://codebutler.com/firesheep/\n\nThe attacker doesn't get your user's credentials, but they can still pretend to be your user, which can be pretty bad. \n\ntl;dr: Sending unencrypted tokens over the wire means that attackers can easily nab those tokens and pretend to be your user. FireSheep is a program that makes this very easy. \n\n### A Separate, More Secure Zone ###\n\nThe larger the application that you're running, the harder it is to absolutely ensure that they won't be able to inject some code that changes how you process sensitive data. Do you absolutely trust your CDN? Your advertisers? Your own code base? \n\nCommon for credit card details and less common for username and password - some implementers keep 'sensitive data entry' on a separate page from the rest of their application, a page that can be tightly controlled and locked down as best as possible, preferably one that is difficult to phish users with. \n\n## Cookie (just means Token) ##\nIt is possible (and common) to put the authentication token in a cookie. This doesn't change any of the properties of auth with the token, it's more of a convenience thing. All of the previous arguments still apply. \n\n## Session (still just means Token) ##\nSession Auth is just Token authentication, but with a few differences that make it seem like a slightly different thing: \n\n* Users start with an unauthenticated token.\n* The backend maintains a 'state' object that is tied to a user's token.\n* The token is provided in a cookie.\n* The application environment abstracts the details away from you.\n\nAside from that, though, it's no different from Token Auth, really.\n\nThis wanders even further from a RESTful implementation - with state objects you're going further and further down the path of plain ol' RPC on a stateful server.  \n\n## OAuth 2.0 ##\n\nOAuth 2.0 looks at the problem of \"How does Software A give Software B access to User X's data without Software B having access to User X's login credentials.\"\n\nThe implementation is very much just a standard way for a user to get a token, and then for a third party service to go \"yep, this user and this token match, and you can get some of their data from us now.\" \n\nFundamentally, though, OAuth 2.0 is just a token protocol. It exhibits the same properties as other token protocols - you still need SSL to protect those tokens - it just changes up how those tokens are generated.\n\nThere are two ways that OAuth 2.0 can help you: \n\n* Providing Authentication/Information to Others \n* Getting Authentication/Information from Others\n\nBut when it comes down to it, you're just... using tokens. \n\n## Back to your question ##\n\nSo, the question that you're asking is \"should I store my token in a cookie and have my environment's automatic session management take care of the details, or should I store my token in Javascript and handle those details myself?\" \n\nAnd the answer is: _do whatever makes you happy_. \n\nThe thing about automatic session management, though, is that there's a lot of magic happening behind the scenes for you. Often it's nicer to be in control of those details yourself. \n\n## I am 21 so SSL is yes ##\n\nThe other answer is: Use https for everything or brigands will steal your users' passwords and tokens.\n",

Your own code base? </p>\n<p>Common for credit card details and less common for username and password - some implementers keep &#39;sensitive data entry&#39; on a separate page from the rest of their application, a page that can be tightly controlled and locked down as best as possible, preferably one that is difficult to phish users with. </p>\n<h2 id=\"cookie-just-means-token-\">Cookie (just means Token)</h2>\n<p>It is possible (and common) to put the authentication token in a cookie. This doesn&#39;t change any of the properties of auth with the token, it&#39;s more of a convenience thing. All of the previous arguments still apply. </p>\n<h2 id=\"session-still-just-means-token-\">Session (still just means Token)</h2>\n<p>Session Auth is just Token authentication, but with a few differences that make it seem like a slightly different thing: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Users start with an unauthenticated token.</li>\n<li>The backend maintains a &#39;state&#39; object that is tied to a user&#39;s token.</li>\n<li>The token is provided in a cookie.</li>\n<li>The application environment abstracts the details away from you.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Aside from that, though, it&#39;s no different from Token Auth, really.</p>\n<p>This wanders even further from a RESTful implementation - with state objects you&#39;re going further and further down the path of plain ol&#39; RPC on a stateful server.  </p>\n<h2 id=\"oauth-2-0\">OAuth 2.0</h2>\n<p>OAuth 2.0 looks at the problem of &quot;How does Software A give Software B access to User X&#39;s data without Software B having access to User X&#39;s login credentials.&quot;</p>\n<p>The implementation is very much just a standard way for a user to get a token, and then for a third party service to go &quot;yep, this user and this token match, and you can get some of their data from us now.&quot; </p>\n<p>Fundamentally, though, OAuth 2.0 is just a token protocol. It exhibits the same properties as other token protocols - you still need SSL to protect those tokens - it just changes up how those tokens are generated.</p>\n<p>There are two ways that OAuth 2.0 can help you: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Providing Authentication/Information to Others </li>\n<li>Getting Authentication/Information from Others</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But when it comes down to it, you&#39;re just... using tokens. </p>\n<h2 id=\"back-to-your-question\">Back to your question</h2>\n<p>So, the question that you&#39;re asking is &quot;should I store my token in a cookie and have my environment&#39;s automatic session management take care of the details, or should I store my token in Javascript and handle those details myself?&quot; </p>\n<p>And the answer is: <em>do whatever makes you happy</em>. </p>\n<p>The thing about automatic session management, though, is that there&#39;s a lot of magic happening behind the scenes for you. Often it&#39;s nicer to be in control of those details yourself. </p>\n<h2 id=\"i-am-21-so-ssl-is-yes\">I am 21 so SSL is yes</h2>\n<p>The other answer is: Use https for everything or brigands will steal your users&#39; passwords and tokens.</p>\n"

  "content": "* *polkadot*: Dear Lord, I'm undergoing training in Scrum methodology over the waterfall method. It's a work process that basically addresses many stages of development at once instead of the traditional Gantt approach of implementing one complete step before moving on to another.\n* *classam*: Yes, I am intimately familiar.  Week-long sprints?\n* *polkadot*: Is dull training. Yes. Sprints.\n* *classam*: So dull. But significantly better than the GANTT-chart and Waterfall hullaballoo. \n* *polkadot*: I already work like this. But interesting to watch someone try to teach a team how to do it. \n* *classam*: I could talk about it at length, but you're coming to your computer to AVOID scrum talk. \n* *polkadot*: \"It takes courage and commitment. Rules and meetings and artifacts.\" \n* *classam*: It's a little more formalized than just \"OKAY, SO YOU GIVE ME WORK AND THEN I DO THE WORK AND THEN THE WORK IS DONE\", which is most common organization strategy\n* *polkadot*: I like how in this Scrum meeting, the artist is thinking about cake. That's usually what we are thinking about. Cake. \n![Scrum 1](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_01.jpg)\n* *classam*: I like that you work with a biplane pilot for some reason\n* *classam*: HE SPEAKS IN INFOGRAPHICS\n* *classam*: \"Oh, that's just Greg. Pay no attention to his shenanigans.\"\n* *classam*: Just another day at the bakery-science-piloting-art-factory.\n* *polkadot*: hehe. We are apparently building unicycles? Buuuuut... the stakeholders would like us to build bicycles. Good thing we have the pilot working on that. \n![Scrum 2](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_02.jpg)\n* *classam*: Also, I wasn't sure about creepy silhouette team\n* *classam*: even less sure now\n* *classam*: they appear to have some sort of medieval torture device\n* *classam*: Have they eaten the artist?\n* *classam*: Was it her insatiable cake-lust that did her in?\n* *classam*: WHEN USING THE SCRUM METHODOLOGY, YOU MAY BE STALKED BY SENTIENT, MALICIOUS SHADOWS. DO NOT LOOK THEM IN THE EYES. \n* *polkadot*: Ultimately, it was decided that in building a bicycle, a cake-lusting artist was not as important as a baker, pilot, and let's say ... um... a pharmacist?\n* *classam*: She designed it and then left it to do her own thing. \"One wheel is more aesthetically pleasing. Here's the PSD.\" Now they're all vigorously blaming her for the setback in the project. \n* *classam*: Well, except for Confusion Brownpants. \n* *classam*: He just walked in from another meeting. \n* *classam*: He has no idea what's going on\n* *classam*: he was just sort of hoping there would be cake\n* *polkadot*: This is the guy teaching the course. It's like the Crocodile Dundee version of Terrance and Philip.\n![Scrum 3](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_03.jpg)\n* *classam*: He takes his dress cues from Confusion Brownpants, but he's clearly a different guy. \n* *classam*: You know what they say: never trust a man who tucks his pants around his shoes. \n* *polkadot*: I'm pretty sure the ginger here is supposed to be a developer. So just so we're clear, they're pretty sure artists are messy, turtle-necked cake-eaters and developers are skinny, ginger dweebs with no fingers. And Scrum Masters are enormous female gym teachers. \n![Scrum 4](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_04.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: is best training\n* *classam*: The Pilot has high priority coming out of his buns\n* *classam*: Also, we meet BLACK HAIR BLACKSHIRT, the villain of the piece. He's no artist - The Artist is already there, covered in cake spoor and regret. You shouldn't make fun of Lady Gym Teacher Scrum-master, though. She's the master because she can talk out the top of her head. Like the C'thonian beast that she likely is. Under that layer of sternness.\n* *polkadot*: The pharmacist is getting totes lippy with you. Smack that bitch up. \n![Scrum 5](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_05.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: she has a lovely British accent too. Kind of a Mary Poppins voice that in no way matcher her butch gym teacher appearance. \n* *polkadot*: Pharmacist sounds like a surfer.\n* *classam*: Dudes. Dudes. Chill. You're not the boss of me. \n* *classam*: The only boss of me? The tides, man. \n* *polkadot*: And Black Hair McGee is the Product Owner. \n* *polkadot*: Is boss man. \n* *polkadot*: Business business. Numbers. \n* *classam*: Why was he standing with the team, then? He should be standing on a GOLDEN PEDESTAL, being showered by offerings of roasted goat rubbed with garlic and virgins. \n* *polkadot*: You really shouldn't rub goats with virgins. Neither party really enjoys that. \n* *classam*: However, you should definitely pelt your project manager with roast goat. \n* *polkadot*:\n![Scrum 6](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_06.jpg)\n* *classam*: ...\n* *classam*: I like him. \n* *polkadot*: speaks in infographics... wants pony... is a simple man with simple needs\n* *polkadot*: a simple pilot who wants a pony demonstrated in illustration\n* *classam*: He seems simple but he has a complex inner monologue. \n* *polkadot*: OK, from what I can gather... the baker is the UI person? \n![Scrum 7](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_07.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: Thanks for your input, Jill. Now shut up and finish that muffin batter you've been holding for the last 45 minutes. \n* *classam*: SORRY, CAN'T HEAR YOU, BAKING\n* *classam*: Why aren't they asking the Pharmacist why he thinks the UI Design isn't quite so easy? Maybe he knows something the team doesn't. \n* *classam*: Our team made it a policy to single out the outliers and make them defend their score. \n* *classam*: Then STEAL THEIR MUFFIN BATTER\n* *polkadot*: Oh ho! Jabs at Explorer! Way to make some commentary, guys!\n![Scrum 8](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_08.jpg)\n* *classam*: And the whole team is just\n* *classam*: crushed\n* *classam*: you can see it in their faces\n* *classam*: \"we thought you were cool, man\"\n* *polkadot*: devastated\n* *polkadot*: Everyone is tired. The developer is the only one who is working.\n![Scrum 9](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_09.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: he is using a drafting table for some reason\n* *classam*: Hey, maybe this job would be less stressful if you had more than one person DOING IT you guys\n* *polkadot*: and, like, a computer\n* *classam*: Greg the Simple Pilot is wearing a deflated life vest\n* *classam*: he is concerned\n* *classam*: that he might drown\n* *polkadot*: Ahhhhhh, I am only HALF way through this training. \n* *classam*: Soon you're going to find out what happens to their bicycle project! It's going to come in overbudget, and they're going to end up eating Greg for sustenance. \n* *polkadot*: Fuck yeah, now we have a minstrel. \n![Scrum 10](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_10.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: for morale\n* *polkadot*: and a rainbow\n* *classam*: She brought it from home\n* *classam*: This team makes terrible hiring decisions\n* *classam*: But the morale girl seems to be working well\n* *polkadot*: I don't know. The pilot and the pharmacist seem just as pissy as usual. \n* *classam*: The pharmacist only has the one face. \n* *classam*: Greg is pissy because he lost his deflated life vest. \n* *classam*: What will save him from drowning now? \n* *classam*: Nothing. \n* *polkadot*: He's pretty happy here, but only because he is questioning the abilities of the coder. He gets to feel superior because no one ever asks, \"what about the pilot?\" in a product development meeting.\n![Scrum 11](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_11.jpg)\n* *classam*: Hey, they're designing a bicycle. There shouldn't BE a lot of code involved. You know what we do need?\n* *classam*: Someone to TEST PILOT the bicycle\n* *classam*: A scientist, to design the bicycle aerodynamics!\n* *classam*: But a coder? Not bloody likely\n* *classam*: Also we're still not sure what the roles of the baker and the artiste are\n* *classam*: MAYBE THEY'RE PLANNING A HEIST\n* *classam*: heist heist heist\n* *classam*: I am very excited about this heist theory\n* *polkadot*: Do wolves somehow factor in to this theory? \n![Scrum 12](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_12.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: As long as you protect the developer from wolves, he will design your bicycle with the pilot and baker. But only then. \n![Scrum 13](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_13.jpg)\n* *classam*: He wasn't going to commit otherwise? \n* *classam*: I have this word for people who refuse to do their jobs:\n* *classam*: Software develop... I mean, \"people who are fired\"\n* *polkadot*: wolf-cowards\n* *classam*: What, you don't want to do your job, JUST because your office is full of hungry timberwolves that walk like men and howl for your blood?\n* *polkadot*: with lightning bolts over their heads\n* *classam*: \"But boss, they command storms with their mighty paws.\"\n* *classam*: \"Don't worry, two stormwolves are no match for a stout, sexually confused middle-aged woman.\" \n* *polkadot*: they prefer to be called gym teachers\n* *classam*: This heist is really shaping up. \n* *classam*: They have their muscle, their escape unicycle, their pilot, their disguise artist, their hacker, the obligatory science dude, craft services, a douche in glasses, it's all coming together\n* *polkadot*: And the pharmacist inexplicably casts no shadow... or at least, no second shadow? that's got to be somehow useful.\n![Scrum 14](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_14.jpg)\n* *classam*: \"Isn't a unicycle a terrible escape vehicle?\"\n* *classam*: \"Look, Scrum is about getting to a minimum viable heist, you guys.\" \n* *classam*: What's worse is the ginger, who casts a shadow even when he isn't THERE\n* *classam*: I KNEW it\n* *classam*: Soulless\n* *polkadot*: And check out this guy. he definitely looks like he could be Heist appropriate.\n![Scrum 15](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_15.jpg)\n* *classam*: He looks like he walked straight out of a con movie\n* *polkadot*: \n![Scrum 16](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_16.jpg)\n* *classam*: He's the brains behind the whole operation, see\n* *classam*: myeah, see\n* *classam*: myeah\n* *polkadot*: \"special favors, see\"\n* *polkadot*: wink wink\n* *classam*: Look, I gots you all out of prisons and jobs at this company. The least you could do is robs me a bank, see. Myeah. \n* *polkadot*: the gym teachers discuss this at a convention\n![Scrum 17](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_17.jpg)\n* *classam*: #8: Sammy Seagull (that rat bastard)\n* *polkadot*: the artist and the gym teacher play catch.\n![Scrum 18](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_18.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: the artist has an elbow in a drastically anatomically incorrect position\n* *classam*: Don't make fun of her deformity\n* *classam*: that's why she became an artist in the first place\n* *polkadot*: is rude\n* *classam*: She wanted to share her pain with the world\n* *polkadot*: \n![Scrum 19](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_19.jpg)\n* *classam*: Tell us your tale of woe, artwoman\n* *polkadot*: The baker makes a valid point. Better than Sammy Seagull.\n![Scrum 20](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_20.jpg)\n* *classam*: You know\n* *classam*: I'm really curious who hired those two in the first place\n* *classam*: I mean, Clueless Clyde has 'clueless' right there in his name\n* *classam*: don't they screen for that sort of thing?\n* *classam*: Also, if your only choices are your Product Owner, or two men chosen based on the fact that they are clearly the two least fit men in the company to lead anything (aside from Simple Greg the Pilot) ... that doesn't say a lot of positive things about the Product Owner\n* *classam*: \"At least he's not one of the two worst employees in the company!\" Glowing praise. \n* *polkadot*: Looks like Simple Greg the Pilot, also a coder. And coder #2, named Andy. How bout that?\n![Scrum 21](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_21.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: Open-Source Pilot Greg would rather be at the beach though, with surfer pharmacist shadowless science-man. \n* *polkadot*: Hahaha. Don't worry, Greg. The BAKER will help you code. \n![Scrum 22](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_22.jpg)\n* *classam*: They're still cleaning up the mess from the last time she tried to code\n* *classam*: \"Will DOUGH work on it?\"\n* *classam*: \"STOP IT\"\n* *classam*: \"Try rubbing it with flour\"\n* *classam*: \"SHOO, SHOO\"\n* *polkadot*: i think I'll order a tab\n* *classam*: All this hacking is thirsty work\n* *polkadot*: Then... big team make-out party. \n![Scrum 23](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_23.jpg)\n* *classam*: :O\n* *classam*: Is that how the tale ends? \n* *classam*: \"We work hard. We play hard.\"\n* *classam*: \"EVERYBODY DANCE NOW\"\n* *polkadot*: nothing particularly humorous has occurred since then. Though the minstrel was never heard from again. \n* *polkadot*: \"And they ate the minstrel. There was much rejoicing. Yay!\"\n* *classam*: Seems legit\n* *polkadot*: we are defining the definition of \"done.\"\n* *polkadot*: Done is defined as done. Not partially done or sort of done. And there you have it. \n* *classam*: So is this lesson done, or just partially sorta done?\n* *polkadot*: Are you using Scrum methodology at home on your whiteboard then? Sort of? Are you the wierd ginger dweeb or the weird infographic pilot that wants a pony? \n![Scrum 24](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_24.jpg)\n* *classam*: My home whiteboard is its own thing\n* *classam*: although admittedly it is partially inspired by my time in a scrum-heavy shop.\n* *classam*: I make no commitments\n* *classam*: There are no stand-ups\n* *classam*: or planning pokers\n* *classam*: I never pair program\n* *classam*: And done is when I damn well feel like it.\n* *polkadot*: Pair programming sounds annoying. I mean, I can understand passing it off to someone else and having them review it, but I would not want to have someone watch over my shoulder. \n* *polkadot*: Oh no! The gym teacher has sprouted monkey ears!\n![Scrum 25](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_25.jpg)\n* *polkadot*: oh good, the minstrel is back. I was worried about her. \n* *polkadot*: And you should definitely be watching out for your boss's invisible pants gun. \n![Scrum 26](http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_26.jpg)\n* *classam*: what is the DEAL with the invisible pants gun? \n* *polkadot*: Oh. That just made me laugh so hard I cried a little. \n* *polkadot*: It was more or less an analogy for the intimidation one feels when one's boss enters the room is like that of a gun being held to an employees head, I guess?\n* *polkadot*: So he has an invisible gun and that's why everyone in the room goes silent when he walks in, even if he's a \"nice guy\", because he is holding them at invisible gunpoint. \n* *classam*: So, the invisible gun is that HE'S THEIR BOSS and HE CAN FIRE THEM ALL ANY TIME HE WANTS RAR RAR BOSS\n* *classam*: ... how in the world did they propose to resolve that? \n* *classam*: Was it with the power of song?\n* *classam*: The minstrel was the hero of the piece all along! \n* *polkadot*: No. That's why they said there was no project manager role in a Scrum team. It held each team member personally accountable. \n* *classam*: Ah, so there's the scrum-master, who is a powerless peon who mostly just reminds people to hand in their homework and schedules meetings, the \"client\", who's there to provide vital feedback, and the team members, who do... work things. \n* *classam*: I find that, in practice, this is rarely the actual case. \n* *classam*: ... oh, and, of course, the minstrel, the baker, the chemist, the ginger ... \n* *polkadot*: And used open and visible goal-markers to drive progress as well as constant communication and meetings, er, except I very clearly still have bosses. \n* *classam*: Heh. \"So... what would you say it is that you DO here?\"\n",

Though the minstrel was never heard from again. </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: &quot;And they ate the minstrel. There was much rejoicing. Yay!&quot;</li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: Seems legit</li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: we are defining the definition of &quot;done.&quot;</li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: Done is defined as done.

I mean, I can understand passing it off to someone else and having them review it, but I would not want to have someone watch over my shoulder. </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: Oh no! The gym teacher has sprouted monkey ears!\n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_25.jpg\" alt=\"Scrum 25\"></li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: oh good, the minstrel is back. I was worried about her. </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: And you should definitely be watching out for your boss&#39;s invisible pants gun. \n<img src=\"http://curtis.lassam.net/images/scrum/scrum_26.jpg\" alt=\"Scrum 26\"></li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: what is the DEAL with the invisible pants gun? </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: Oh. That just made me laugh so hard I cried a little. </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: It was more or less an analogy for the intimidation one feels when one&#39;s boss enters the room is like that of a gun being held to an employees head, I guess?</li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: So he has an invisible gun and that&#39;s why everyone in the room goes silent when he walks in, even if he&#39;s a &quot;nice guy&quot;, because he is holding them at invisible gunpoint. </li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: So, the invisible gun is that HE&#39;S THEIR BOSS and HE CAN FIRE THEM ALL ANY TIME HE WANTS RAR RAR BOSS</li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: ... how in the world did they propose to resolve that? </li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: Was it with the power of song?</li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: The minstrel was the hero of the piece all along! </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: No. That&#39;s why they said there was no project manager role in a Scrum team. It held each team member personally accountable. </li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: Ah, so there&#39;s the scrum-master, who is a powerless peon who mostly just reminds people to hand in their homework and schedules meetings, the &quot;client&quot;, who&#39;s there to provide vital feedback, and the team members, who do... work things. </li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: I find that, in practice, this is rarely the actual case. </li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: ... oh, and, of course, the minstrel, the baker, the chemist, the ginger ... </li>\n<li><em>polkadot</em>: And used open and visible goal-markers to drive progress as well as constant communication and meetings, er, except I very clearly still have bosses. </li>\n<li><em>classam</em>: Heh. &quot;So... what would you say it is that you DO here?&quot;</li>\n</ul>\n"

Wait. No. That doesn't sound good.\n<ffff> lol kw\n<classam|work> Honestly, I think that that link is pretty tame considering how the sentence started \"I meant this kind of leather bodysuit\"\n<plypkie> and cdemwel1 mentioned his involved leather bodysuits and duckface\n<cdemwel1> oh, I guess my URL doesn't seem like a motorcycle link\n<cdemwel1> but it is\n<plypkie> seems like you'd get bugs in your teeth if duckfacing while motorcycling\n<cdemwel1> he was just posing\n<yangman> welp. I guess that could have gone smoother, but considering I haven't actually done this in a few years and uber short notice, GOOD ENOUGH\n<yangman> and now it's lunch time\n<plypkie> what was that for?\n<yangman> TinyCo\n<yangman> maker of those farmville type games for mobile that are transparently psychologically manipulative but OH GOD WHY CAN'T I STOP TAPPING ON COINS\n<yangman> but, whatever. people are willing to pay for it\n<plypkie> heh\n<yangman> their tech is kinda cool. apparently they have an engine where you write C++ and it turns out iOS and Android versions automagically\n<yangman> and whole buncha neat stuff happening on the backend with analytics\n<yangman> otherwise, fairly typical SF deal, I guess. funded by some big names\n<yangman> they're trying to open a vancouver office\n<yangman> looking at the pace things are going, they wanted the office open a month ago\n<lumy> heh.\n<yangman> so, near as I can tell, TinyVillage is about slavery\n<yangman> slavery for arbitrary capital gains, even\n<yangman> you have these guys, working farms and mines and lumber mills\n<yangman> generating resources, paying taxes\n<yangman> there are stores where you can turn said resources into money and \"EXP\"\n<yangman> (and, everything is designed such that you have to baby sit it to actually work, because everybody hates automation)\n<yangman> and the EXP, in turn, unlocks more structures you can build using money and resources\n<lumy> yangman: well.. they guys wanting you to spend as much time in game as possible certinly do.\n<yangman> except, everything just kinda vaporizes into thin air\n<yangman> I mean, you can build ropes and hammers and fancy stone clubs\n<yangman> but none of it actually increases the productivity of your dwellers\n<yangman> the taxes each dwelling generates is so small in comparison to its cost and maintenance that you have no incentive to increase population unless those people can be put to work\n<yangman> afaict, the player isn't so much an architect and planner but more the janitor\n<yangman> because everything poops coins, apparently\n<yangman> that flower bush over there? generates coins every 30 minutes\n<yangman> the fountain? fills up with coins every 2 hours\n<yangman> that rock? coins\n<yangman> palm tree? coins\n<yangman> if you don't sweep up all the coins, you get these unsightly \"OMG I'M FULL OF COINS\" popup everywhere\n<yangman> of course, once you do clean the, they just go poop more coins\n<yangman> it's madness I tells ya\n<yangman> madness\n<yangman> oh, and there's dinosaurs involved, somehow\n<yangman> and a magic glowing rock that hungers for resoruces and coins and EXP so that it may GROW EVER BIGGER\n<yangman> I guess what I'm saying is ALL HAIL THE MAGIC ROCK\n<classam|work> \"We made a game. It's exactly like Dwarf Fortress, except we took the robust simulation engine out and replaced it with clicking on coins.\"\n<gtz> pax hotels are live\n<yangman> LIVE\n<ffff> (and by \"live\" she means \"ALREADY TEEMING WITH AVIAN EBOLA HERPES\")\n<yangman> all the viruses\n<gtz> they're aliiiiiive\n<jeikobu> With the sounds of...\n<yangman> mucus?\n<ffff> applauds\n<plypkie> pox prime\n<gtz> I just checked the group booking stuf\n<gtz> there's no difference in price\n<gtz> it just allows you to book blocks of up to 25 rooms at once\n<gtz> so, welp now we know\n<ffff> ha\n<classam|work> LIVE LIVE LIVITY LIVE :P\n<classam|work> gtz: Thanks for the heads up\n<gtz> woo\n",
